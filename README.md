# Binary Jump extension for Visual Studio Code
Binary Jump is a VS Code extension that helps in faster code navigation by allowing you to jump half the distance from current cursor to either direction.

## How it work
Below are the shortcut keys to use this extension.

#### Left Jump
| Shortcut Keys | Platform |
| ------------- | -------- |
| `ctrl+alt+meta+left` | Windows or Unix |
| `ctrl+cmd+alt+left` | Mac |

#### Right Jump
| Shortcut Keys | Platform |
| ------------- | -------- |
| `ctrl+alt+meta+right` | Windows or Unix |
| `ctrl+cmd+alt+right` | Mac |

#### Up Jump
| Shortcut Keys | Platform |
| ------------- | -------- |
| `ctrl+alt+meta+up` | Windows or Unix |
| `ctrl+cmd+alt+up` | Mac |

#### Down Jump
| Shortcut Keys | Platform |
| ------------- | -------- |
| `ctrl+alt+meta+down` | Windows or Unix |

`meta` key is same as the window sign key on your keyboard.
To help understand better how it works and how it is useful, let's see it in action.

In above code if you want to change the text `Applying options` you can go the start of the line by pressing home button then do block jumps using `ctrl+right` but that will still take 3-4 keypresses to get there.
By using binary jump you can get there in 2 keypresses using a left jump (`ctrl+alt+meta+left`) and then one block jump (`ctrl+left`)

Here's another example where let's say you want to change the parameters of the replace_components function. You can do a binary jump at opt and then one block jump

You can use custom keybindings for the jumps by assigning your keys to the commands `binaryJump.binaryRightJump` and `binaryJump.binaryLeftJump`
